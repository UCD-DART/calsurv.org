                        Creating Reports in R Workshop:

                        VectorSurv users will earn how to access their agency's data in R using the VectorSurv API and create a report using RMarkdown. Prior experience with R or an understanding of the API is not required to benefit from the workshop. We will walk you through how to load your data and create a report using the pre-coded short sample report. The workshop will be recorded and posted on the <a href="https://youtube.com/#vectorsurv"> VectorSurv YouTube</a>. If you are visiting this page after the workshop, the PDF documentation on GitHub will walk you through how to use the code to access your data and create a customizable report.
