## Collection Management Table

**Filter By:**

- **Date** lets you select a custom timeframe to search for records.

  - Select the timeframe for which you wish to view collections by
    choosing the appropriate values using the start and end
    datepickers. You can type a date value in the format set under
    [Account
    Preferences]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/settings/account-preferences)
    or pick a date using the datepicker UI. The \# column on the
    left with the gray boxes represent disease weeks. Clicking on a
    disease week number will autopopulate the start/end inputs with
    the appropriate values for that disease week. The table is
    sorted by most recent collection date then collection number by
    default, but you can sort the table by any field by clicking on
    the column name.

  - Beneath the table, you can navigate between pages using the
    arrows or clicking on a page number. You can also change how
    many collections to display on a single page using the
    **Items/page** dropdown option. The table is sorted by most
    recently updated pool by default, but you can sort the table by
    any field by clicking on the column name.

- **Recent** displays the most recent records to view. The default is
  10, but you can use the dropdown to change the number of records to
  display. The table is sorted by most recently updated record then by
  collection number by default, but you can sort the table by any
  field by clicking on the column name.

You can also use the search box on the right to filter results by site
code, collection ID or other keywords. Clicking the X button will remove
the search filter and display the entire table.
