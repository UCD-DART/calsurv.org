The [VectorSurv Gateway Sandbox](https://sandbox.vectorsurv.org/) is the system’s “playground” environment. Data entered to the VectorSurv Sandbox are a copy of the VectorSurv Gateway’s data and settings through the previous week. Data in the Sandbox do not persist, as the Sandbox is reset each weekend to exactly match the data and settings that are found in the VectorSurv Gateway at the time of the reset. This environment aims to be a testing space where users are allowed to experiment with entering or importing data, changing settings, and using the various website features without any risks to the data that has been entered into the live VectorSurv Gateway. This ensures that users are able to try out all of the existing or newly released features of VectorSurv risk-free before using them within the VectorSurv Gateway.
